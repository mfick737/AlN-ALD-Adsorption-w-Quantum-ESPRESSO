# AlN-ALD-Adsorption-w-Quantum-ESPRESSO

Hello,

This repository contains examples of files I used to run and/or analyze 
density functional theory (DFT) calculations that investiaged surface reactions on aluminum nitride (AlN) slabs.

Although many of the keywords/variables stated in the example files are the ones I used to perform tests, some
variables like folder locations have been modified. 

This repository contains two kinds of files:
1) Quantum ESPRESSO input files
2) Python scripts
3) Bash .sh executable scripts

The syntax of QE input files for various QE executables (pw.x, bands.x, ph.x etc.) can be found online.

The python and bash scripts were used to create, analyze, or run input files

I plan on publishing some of the results from my investigation on an open-source platform in the near future.
